I’m **Archit Srivastava**, an MS GIS student at the University of Redlands with professional experience
supporting enterprise GIS environments and building web mapping applications.

**Focus areas**
- ArcGIS Enterprise (Portal/Server, publishing, troubleshooting, performance)
- Web GIS products (StoryMaps, Dashboards, Instant Apps)
- Python automation (repeatable workflows, validation, data handling)

This portfolio is for **GIS 661** and will expand as I add more projects and web mapping work.
